# Cell_Aware_Defect_Modeling_Tool - Purpose of Study Project

Scientific Problem:
In the manufacturing test, there is certain level of nominal frequency set for the delay measured in the circuit. The delay due to small delay defects are not detected in these tests as the delay is too small and well within the margin. But this delay might increase in the field level due to various parameters and becomes stronger.
Result of the Problem:
Resulting in early life failure (ELF) of the device.
Solution to the Problem:
Insert resistive defects with high probability that would result in small delay in the circuit using the layout and netlist information of the cell
Generating the efficient & realistic defect models that would help in analysis of small delay
